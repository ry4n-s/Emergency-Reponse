# Emergency Response 🚨 

### Description 🌟:
Welcome to Emergency Response, a C++ project that's as dynamic and fast-paced as the real-life scenarios it emulates! 🌆 This repository is more than just code; it's a simulation of emergency response routes in a city, helping first responders to navigate efficiently and save lives. 🚑🚒🚓

### 🏙️ Key Features:

Dynamic Graph Creation 🌍: Build and manipulate a graph where vertices are city intersections and edges are the roads connecting them.

Dijkstra's Algorithm with O(ElogV) 🔍: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a MinHeap/Priority Queue, achieving a runtime of O(ElogV) for finding the shortest paths.

Real-time Traffic Adjustments 🚦: Incorporate an "adjustment factor" to simulate real-world traffic conditions, impacting travel times between intersections.

Efficient Pathfinding 🛣️: Efficiently calculate the quickest routes for emergency vehicles, considering distance, speed limits, and traffic conditions.

Robust I/O and Error Handling 📚: Handle input/output commands robustly, including LOAD, INSERT, DELETE, PRINT, PATH, TRAFFIC, UPDATE, and LOWEST, with comprehensive error checking.

### Technical Overview 💡:

Adjacency List Implementation 📈: Utilize an adjacency list for graph representation, optimizing space and traversal efficiency.

Traffic-Influenced Weight Calculation ⚖️: Edge weights are dynamically calculated considering distance, speed limit, and the traffic adjustment factor.

Memory Management and Efficiency 🧠: Crafted with attention to memory safety and efficiency.
